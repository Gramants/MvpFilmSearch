<b>Android Projects</b><br><br>
<b>Tyffer (Startup cofounder)</b>
<p>The native java Android application is the app front-end of the social marketing platform Tyffer: www.tyffer.com.
    I developed both client and server mechanics and architecture. Tyffer is a product of an Italian startup in which I'm the cofounder and CTO. The Android application give the possibility to users to choose from a bulk of categories of offer in which are interested. Offers  are launched by merchants registered in Tyffer and they have a big set of web instruments (the merchants interface is written in jquery mobile) for launching both offer and events. The application presents  a custom registration form and a category chooser fragment. I developed a custom SMS gateway to complete the registration form as well as the possibility to sign up with Facebook and Google +. Users can choose to book offers or not.</p>


<b>Dimmi  (Data Management)</b>
<p>Application front end in Android to let the client of DataManagement SPA (my permanent work) open remotely trouble ticketing to corporate company system. The app let the user authenticate by means of REST session-driven call to DataManagement server (LDAP). Then user can choose for which environment (JSON response) he can open ticket to. For user and superuser the entry form are different. Had to make a full reverse engineering of the Java corporate web application to be able to build servlet for webservices, guiding all the ticketing opening processes from app.</p>
